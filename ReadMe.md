Technologies used:
I used html,css, javascript languages to make my blackjack game. I also Googled some things and came across
sweetAlert which is a library of methods to substitute the alert method 'alert()'. I used materialize as well
for some styling. I also used jQuery.

Process/Approach:
So I had my game work where the player and dealer pull cards and once the stand button is pressed, that
is when the cards are flipped and a winner is determined. When you win money is added to your balance.

Future Features:
I am thinking about adding more games than blackjack to try and maybe work towards an actual casino website.
I am also thinking about adding another player.

Bugs:
The ace does not function how I want it automatically but I am thinking about having the user just choose
what value they want to use (11 or 1).

Win:
I would say my biggest win is to finally make a fully functioning site and having an actual blackjack game
with a wager form. If I had to pick one goal that stood out, I would say it was having the cards appear on
the page.

Losses:
I would say my biggest lost would be my balance value giving me more trouble than anticipated.

Game:
blackjack

Rules:
In the Rules.md file

Process for turning game into a web application:
1) I made my user stories (userstories.md)
2) I made my wireframes (images/wireframes)
3) I made a Trello board (https://trello.com/b/XIO4LakI/blackjack)
4) I tackled most of the logic first.
5) When ever I got stuck on my logic I moved to css or html so I was not wasting time but still clearing
my brain from javascript.
6) Once I had my game finished I moved on to the overall site and did more styling to create a better
user experience.
